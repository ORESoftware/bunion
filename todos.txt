1,2,3,4,5 --> log levels
in regular mode, when user hits these keys, it changes the log level


-----------

have to remove first line from file, after file grows bigger than 5 million bytes or what not

shift + up/down = find next match



\u001b[Z  => shift+tab will find the most recent match, not the next match

it can find the most recent match by reading the file backwards




-----------

ctrl-p  and then s (stop)
you are reading from an older point than the latest


Buffer.byteLength('')

instead of

Buffer.from('').length


tab \t should not starting tailing and then stop,
instead it should using scrollDown style functionality?

the reason for this is the line break -----[ctrl-t]------ is kinda ugly


use array instead of object:



['@bunion', appname, date, level, pid, fields, value]


{"@bunion":true, "appName":"default", "date":"2019-07-17T06:39:37.504Z","level":"ERROR", "pid":4044, "host":"alexs-mac.local", "fields":null, "value":"burrito"}

["@bunion", "app:default", "2019-07-17T06:39:37.504Z", "ERROR", 4044, "alexs-mac.local", null, "burrito"]
